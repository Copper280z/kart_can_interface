# CAN Sensor Interface #

This is firmware for a device that manages various sensors and broadcasts their values over CAN.

## Hardware ##

This firmware is targeting the STM32H743 based MicoAir743 flight controller, which is also sold under other brands and is available for ~$35-$50.

This was chosen because it's relatively cheap, off the shelf, has connectors, and has a CAN transciever. In the future other targets might be added.
